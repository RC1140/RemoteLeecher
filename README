Remote Leecher is a simple web app that aims to make
transfering files in low bandwidth areas easy.

A typical example would be you need files from a remote server.
Steps to get the files with remote leecher would resemble something similiar

1.) Connect a Harddisk/USB Drive on the remote server
2.) Drag and drop files from the remote servers drive to your drive 
3.) Request a disconnect
4.) Arrange for harddisk/USB disk to be shipped to you

While this may seem like a extreme scenario it is supprising just how often
it occurs in non first world countries.

This way also means that users do not need remote access to the server via 
the normal means e.g. Remote Desktop or VPN

Requirements :

A Mongodb server : Get this from the mongodb site
Pymono : easy_install pymongo
Flask : easy_install Flask
ExtJs (Latest Version) : http://www.sencha.com/products/js/download.php

Note : If easy install is not found , you can get it easily via apt-get install python-setuptools

Config Changes :

Change line 107 to list the folders that you want to list in you treeview

Running :
There are 2 ways of running the app , via the dev server or apache
For a example on how to setup using apache , check the Flask homepage

To run it via the dev server 
Firt navigate to the directory in which its located.
Then type 'python remoteLeecher.py' in your commandline
